# Transformers

## Overview:
This project contains my custom solutions for building a Transformer model from scratch. This project is divided into the following sub-modules:
1. Language Translator: Uses the "Attention is All You Need" paper as a reference to construct a transformer model with multi-headed attention, encoder and decoder modules, to translate english to hindi. This model has also been trained on english-to-hindi data to help evalulate model performance.

2. Summarization: (Currently in Development)

3. Custom Embeddings: (TBD)

## Environment Instructions:
If you are using vscode or other such IDE, you can use the below steps to set up a virtual environment to install all package dependencies.
```shell
$ python3 -m venv .my_venv
```
```shell
